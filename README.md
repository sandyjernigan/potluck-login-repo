# Product Canvas

## Proposal

### What problem does your app solve?

Client wants to have an application that allows the user to login and manage potlucks. 

### Be as specific as possible; how does your app solve the problem?

This app will allow:
- The user to login
- Manage their own potluck event
- Invite friends to attend the potluck event 
- Adjust dates, location, and times of their own events
- Has a list feature to add food items
- Guests should be able to confirm they are going to the event
- Guests should be able to select items to bring.


### What is the mission statement?

Help organizers and attendees plan potluck scheduling and food items.

## Features

### What features are required for your minimum viable product?

1. As an organizer I can create an upcoming potluck and invite my friends to attend.
2. As an organizer I can adjust dates, times and locations of the potluck.
3. As an organize I can use the list feature in my app to add food items that we'd like to see at the potluck.
4. As a guest to a potluck I want to be able to confirm that I'm going to the upcoming event.
5. As a guest I'd like to be able to select which items I'd like to be responsible for bringing.

### Target Audience

- Who is your target audience? Be specific.

Anyone who is planning or attending a potluck.

- What feedback have you gotten from potential users?

Past potlucks had people bringing mostly drinks and there was not enough food.
Having people coming but not bring anything
Waiting until the last minute to say they are coming and randomly bring something.
Having people sign up others and say they are bringing something without the guest knowing about it.

- Have you validated the problem and your solution with your target audience? How?

Sign up list for items to bring
List of Maximum amounts of items, have categories that have limits of the number of items that can be signup under the category
RVSP date and time, emails guests to remind them to reply with “going”, “not going”, “don’t know”
Guests can create a login to secure what they sign up for. 

### Research

- Research thoroughly before writing a single line of code. Solidify the features of your app conceptually before implementation. Spend the weekend researching so you can hit the ground running on Monday.
Prototype Key Feature(s)

- This is the “bread and butter” of the app, this is what makes your app yours. Calculate how long it takes to implement these features and triple the time estimated. That way you’ll have plenty of time to finish. It is preferred to drop features and spend more time working on your MVP features if needed.
