# Product Canvas

## Proposal

### What problem does your app solve?

> This app will allow the event planner to log in and see the events they are currently planning, as well as review past events.

### Be as specific as possible; how does your app solve the problem?

> The Corporate Event Planner site will consist of a marketing landing page. This site will also include an app that will have a login page landing page. After logging in there will be a collection of current events as well as links to past events. When the user clicks on an event it will go to a single event page, in which the user can see more about that event, edit, or delete data.

### What is the mission statement?

We have a vault of Lifestyle Adventure packages that our Creative team has designed to take celebrating occasions to a whole new level of turn up!

### What do the top 3 similar apps do for their users?

I'm not sure about the top 3, but these are the top 3 from doing a simple search.

- https://gogather.net/ - Team works with local and global destinations. They have a nice landing page. I don't see any login ability. The "Services" link does not work. The "Our Work" Link has cards with different events planned and information about those events. "Contact Us" has a form, phone number, email, and address to contact the company.

- http://raglandproductions.com/ - This site does events with inflatable rental. Landing page with contact information at bottom of the page. "Attractions" link includes cards for the different inflatable options for rent or things for purchase for an event. This company focus is more for planning an event for the families of a company or for church / school events.

- http://www.thedetailsevents.com/corporate -- This site offers more than corporate events. Looking at the corporate event page, they have a nice landing page. They have a link to "Free Consultation" however it is not working. They do have a contact page, in which you can select a consultation time. They have a blog about events, and a gallery of pictures from events. Clicking a picture in the gallery takes you to more information about that event.
