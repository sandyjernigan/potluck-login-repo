# Corporate Event Planner

The Corporate Event Planner site will consist of a marketing landing page.  
This site will also include an app that will have a login page landing page.  
After logging in there will be a collection of current events as well as links to past events.  
When the user clicks on an event it will go to a single event page, in which the user can see more about that event, edit, or delete data.

## Mission Statement?
